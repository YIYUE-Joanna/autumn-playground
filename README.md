## 🎨 About This Project

This project was born from my passion for colors, creative arts, and preserving beautiful moments. As autumn leaves fall and transform the world with their vibrant hues, I wanted to create an interactive experience that lets people capture and play with these colors in their own space.

I developed this using **AI as a creative collaborator**, combining my vision for interactive art with AI-assisted development to rapidly prototype and iterate. This project represents my approach to modern creative technology: leveraging AI tools to bring artistic visions to life faster and more beautifully.
